# Pomodoro Timer App

## By: Waed Hafitha.


## About Pomodoro Timer:
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task. The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.

This application was built using React.js library.

<br>

<b>The original technique has six steps:</b>

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5. If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

This Application is using React Hooks component to build the Pomodoro timer or the 25 + 5 clock.
